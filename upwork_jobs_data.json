I would like to schedule a consultation regarding email marketing. A bit of a background on my situation - I run ads on Facebook for pharmaceutical companies. Once people click on the ad and fill out the form, they are then taken to the website. The website also requires them to fill out an additional form to convert the lead. In some cases, people don't move forward and leave the website. Since I already have their email addresses I send them a follow-up email asking them to complete the form on the website. For these purposes, I use zapier.com to transfer data from FB and then send Emails using activehosted.com. However, the outcome is not great and I think it can be improved. I need a consultation on which products I can use (looking to save money here) and what type of automated email marketing strategy will work best for my case. Please let me know if this is something you can help me with.

Task 2 Create a CurrentUserStore that uses the UserModel type you just wrote in Task 1. A starter file is located at ~/src/stores/CurrentUser.store.ts.

Create button that calls the API without refreshing the page. Component should allow editing of user's name and age. Store current user information in browser local storage. Load information on page load, if exists. Create button to clear all user information. DisplayUsername Component should display the user's username. Username = user.name + user.age (Example: Eric30, Moshe25, Chaim42) Only the first 10 chars of a name should be displayed in the username, but the full name should be saved (even longer than 10 chars). Ensure that the first letter of the username is capital, and that rest of the letter are lowercase. Changes in the user's name and age should be automatically reflected in this component utilizing MobX reactivity. MongoDB/Mongoose Task 1 Write a simple Mongoose user schema.
