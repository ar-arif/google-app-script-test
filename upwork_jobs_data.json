I would like to schedule a consultation regarding email marketing. A bit of a background on my situation - I run ads on Facebook for pharmaceutical companies. Once people click on the ad and fill out the form, they are then taken to the website. The website also requires them to fill out an additional form to convert the lead. In some cases, people don't move forward and leave the website. Since I already have their email addresses I send them a follow-up email asking them to complete the form on the website. For these purposes, I use zapier.com to transfer data from FB and then send Emails using activehosted.com. However, the outcome is not great and I think it can be improved. I need a consultation on which products I can use (looking to save money here) and what type of automated email marketing strategy will work best for my case.

The purpose of the script is to export (or save-as) various versions of the open PS file with different layers made either visible or invisible, and then save a JSON file with the metadata for each version. Here are the details. The PS file has multiple layers which are organized into multiple groups. For example, let’s say there are 3 groups with 3 layers each. For starters, the script should be able to run through all possible permutations of these 9 layers, exporting 27 different files (the first would be Group 1 Layer 1 + Group 2 Layer 1 + Group 3 Layer 1; the second would be G1L1+G2L1+G3L2; the third would be G1L1+G2L1+G3L3; etc.). The script should ask a few questions at the outset. First, how many output files do I want to create, or do I want to create the maximum number? If not the maximum number, do I want the script to select the layers based on the order in the file, or select them randomly? (For example, using my example above, if I ran the script and requested 5 files and then ran it again and requested 5 files, would the output be identical?) Second, what is the name and description of the image collection (for metadata purposes)? Third, what is desired file export type (PNG, JPG or SVG) and details (meaning, select image quality; do I want to reduce/increase the file size the same way I can if I use Photoshop’s File-Export As feature, selecting 0.5x, 4x, etc.)? If possible, at the end of these questions, the script should give me an estimate of how much time will be required and allow me to abort the process. The script should create a subfolder of the same directory as the open PS file, named with the date and time of the run (for example, “Batch 20220211-1106”]. The files should be exported as PNG and saved to a subfolder of the new Batch directory (“Images”). The file names should just be numbers from 1 to the number of exports (so the third export would be 3.png). For each file exported, the script should save three JSON files in separate subfolders of the Batch folder, with metadata for that file in the JSON formats expected by OpenSea, Rarible & SuperRare. Each JSON should have the same name as the file, so for the third export the metadata would be 3.json. The metadata should be pulled from the layer and group names in Photoshop. We also need to be able to tag certain layers and/or groups as always visible, or always invisible. I could see doing this by putting a tag at the end of the layer/group name like [ALL] and [0], respectively, but am open to other methods. We also need to be able to tag whether a given group can have just one layer visible in each export, multiple layers visible in a single export, and zero layers visible. Again, this could be done by tagging the group name with [1] for only 1 layer, [1+] for one or more layers, [1-2] for 1 or 2 layers, or [0-1] for 1 layer or no layers. Those tags would need to be excluded from the metadata, of course. When the script is done running, it should present a summary showing how many files were exported, how long it took and how long it took per file on average. A log file should be written to the PS file’s folder showing each action taken with a timestamp. This script will be used in a Windows environment on a Creative Cloud release of Photoshop, if that matters. There are public examples of simple versions of this script. For example, see https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine_ps_script/releases/tag/v1.0.0. This one will basically do what I described as the base-case, creating the requested number of variations and saving OpenSea metadata. It doesn’t have any of the tagging functionality that I referenced above, nor the ability to set the export file size, nor the additional JSON file types. But it’s a start! There are other examples out there on the web as well. If you are interested in the project, please let us know (1) what other information you need from us, (2) what your price would be to write and QA this script, (3) what experience you have with projects like this, and (4) how long you think it would take for you to start and finish the project.

Goal: to leverage our Network's voice as amplifiers of the idea Objective: Analyse 25 companies' communications to identify the successful application of our core messaging and narrative. What we are measuring: Approx 25 companies (references can include mentions from spokespeople, CXOs, or simply the organisation) Measuring the following (details to be provided): 1) Use of our core message 2) Use of two words that relate to our work 3) Evidence of our narrative (a list of approximately ten possible phrases and keywords) In each of these, we'll be looking at: How many companies?

We are looking for a (NFT) 3D / graphic / cartoon / illustration designer who can help with our NFT project. Our project of 10.000 generative NFTs will revolve around masks. We are really charmed by the idea that everyone on the internet is wearing a mask, pretending or acting the way they want without fully exposing themselves - just like we used to when we played ‘pretend’ when we were kids. We want to emphasize this even more by launching a NFT project with kids wearing masks, where the mask is the key feature of every NFT. This way, even your NFT can be whoever or whatever they want to be, without exposing themselves ;). Eventually the NFT will be made up in layers to add different traits and make each design unique. As the designer of this project, you’re free to design the traits to fit the concept. We have a rough sketch, you are allowed to adjust it and to do the fine-tuning for the final result. It is important, however, to keep in mind that the design will be made up in layers and that the mask is the key feature of the NFT. Interested? Before we hire a designer to work on the whole concept, designs and traits, we want to make sure he or she understands the idea. That is why we ask you to work out a (couple of) design(s) with background (paid, of course). Within the design, it is essential that there is a kid wearing a mask that has different traits made up in layers. The rest is up to your imagination, you can make up the traits or themes and use all sorts of colours - show us what you got! NOTE: The budget is $100 for the design(s) that you would deliver.

We are really charmed by the idea that everyone on the internet is wearing a mask, pretending or acting the way they want without fully exposing themselves - just like we used to when we played ‘pretend’ when we were kids. We want to emphasize this even more by launching a NFT project with kids wearing masks, where the mask is the key feature of every NFT. This way, even your NFT can be whoever or whatever they want to be, without exposing themselves ;). Eventually the NFT will be made up in layers to add different traits and make each design unique. As the designer of this project, you’re free to design the traits to fit the concept. We have a rough sketch, you are allowed to adjust it and to do the fine-tuning for the final result. It is important, however, to keep in mind that the design will be made up in layers and that the mask is the key feature of the NFT. Interested? Before we hire a designer to work on the whole concept, designs and traits, we want to make sure he or she understands the idea. That is why we ask you to work out a (couple of) design(s) with background (paid, of course). Within the design, it is essential that there is a kid wearing a mask that has different traits made up in layers. The rest is up to your imagination, you can make up the traits or themes and use all sorts of colours - show us what you got! NOTE: The budget is $100 for the design(s) that you would deliver.

It is mainly written in PHP but I decided to renew the enrollment system for teachers, classes and students to make it more user friendly. The old system required the uploading of a .csv file and did no error checking. If it didn't work, the local school administrator had no idea what was wrong. We decided to build a new system using node.js (not realizing that there was difficulty passing parameters back and forth, but we solved that by using cookies). The person I hired was able to create a satisfactory system on our \"development\" server, but when we moved the code to the production server, we couldn't get it to work even though the two systems are 99% the same. (The production server code was about 10 months old so differences had crept in.). Unfortunately the person we hired was 'expert' at php and nodes.js but knew next to nothing about manipulating Linux. I told him, for example, to use \"tail\" to see the most recent errors in the error log, and he had never heard of it! :-( What we need is someone to look at the code and settings on the production server and make the node.js functionality work. It might be a very quick fix, but I'll pay well to get it working! I've attached a composite that shows the starting steps of the new system that works on the development server. You can see some of the error checking.","posted":"13 days ago","price":"Hourly","type":"Intermediate","duration":"Less than 1 month, Less than 30 hrs/week","proposal":"Less than 5","country":"Japan","skills":["Web Design","App Design","Adobe Photoshop","eBook Design","Adobe Illustrator","Adobe InDesign","Magazine Layout","Packaging Design","Infographic","UX/UI","Landing Page","Layout Design","UI/UX Prototyping"],"url":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Activation-node-implementation-site-mainly-using-PHP_~013556688014893ade/"},{"title":"Scott Project v1.0","description":"6 pages and a editable blog page.

As per your initial recommendations for the following basic flow: 1) User signs up for a course on your website.  2) Using the webhook we receive the data and trigger the mail. (can be both custom or via zapier or a combination of both) 3) In the composed mail, we send them calendly link along with other information (invoice link, course details etc).  4) Calendly has a great api to connect with zapier. We use that to trigger another mail after they have signed up.  5) A separate cron will maintain and monitor the course details, and trigger another mail and add the name to the mailer after 4 days have passed since the course commenced. This would be the end trigger. (This is your previous email: Automation is not a very precise process. Since we connect two different apis together, there are, at times, requirements for workarounds or conditional formatting to fit in the data according to the other api's requirement. So to estimate the hours here is not an exact process. We have three different automations here. I'd say, let's keep one working day initially for each (3 X 8 hours).

It is mainly written in PHP but I decided to renew the enrollment system for teachers, classes and students to make it more user friendly. The old system required the uploading of a .csv file and did no error checking. If it didn't work, the local school administrator had no idea what was wrong. We decided to build a new system using node.js (not realizing that there was difficulty passing parameters back and forth, but we solved that by using cookies). The person I hired was able to create a satisfactory system on our \"development\" server, but when we moved the code to the production server, we couldn't get it to work even though the two systems are 99% the same. (The production server code was about 10 months old so differences had crept in.). Unfortunately the person we hired was 'expert' at php and nodes.js but knew next to nothing about manipulating Linux. I told him, for example, to use \"tail\" to see the most recent errors in the error log, and he had never heard of it! :-( What we need is someone to look at the code and settings on the production server and make the node.js functionality work. It might be a very quick fix, but I'll pay well to get it working! I've attached a composite that shows the starting steps of the new system that works on the development server. You can see some of the error checking.","posted":"13 days ago","price":"Hourly","type":"Intermediate","duration":"Less than 1 month, Less than 30 hrs/week","proposal":"Less than 5","country":"Japan","skills":["Web Design","App Design","Adobe Photoshop","eBook Design","Adobe Illustrator","Adobe InDesign","Magazine Layout","Packaging Design","Infographic","UX/UI","Landing Page","Layout Design","UI/UX Prototyping"],"url":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Activation-node-implementation-site-mainly-using-PHP_~013556688014893ade/"},{"title":"Scott Project v1.0","description":"6 pages and a editable blog page.

As per your initial recommendations for the following basic flow: 1) User signs up for a course on your website.  2) Using the webhook we receive the data and trigger the mail. (can be both custom or via zapier or a combination of both) 3) In the composed mail, we send them calendly link along with other information (invoice link, course details etc).  4) Calendly has a great api to connect with zapier. We use that to trigger another mail after they have signed up.  5) A separate cron will maintain and monitor the course details, and trigger another mail and add the name to the mailer after 4 days have passed since the course commenced. This would be the end trigger. (This is your previous email: Automation is not a very precise process. Since we connect two different apis together, there are, at times, requirements for workarounds or conditional formatting to fit in the data according to the other api's requirement. So to estimate the hours here is not an exact process. We have three different automations here. I'd say, let's keep one working day initially for each (3 X 8 hours).

This website uses the Uncode theme along with WPBakery page builder. A similar library was created as a part of the Northdoor website – although that site was custom built and did not use Uncode. See the Northdoor library here: https://www.northdoor.co.uk/about-us/resources The library will consist of documents that can include PDF, Excel, Word Doc / Docx and hosted video’s that administrators can upload to the website. Users will be able to reach the library either via a dedicated ‘resources’ - or by navigating to an individual suppliers page and seeing the associated suppliers resources there. The resources main page On the main resources page, the individual resources will be presented in a masonry grid style layout using Uncode’s masonry grid option, selecting the new custom post type for resources, with each resource represented by a featured image, title, excerpt, and category. Filters The resources grid will initially show ALL resources. Users will be able to filter by category (clicking on a category title at the top of the page) which will hide and display resulting resources in an Ajax style. Search Users will also be able to search resources using a free text search box. The search will function on titles, tags and copy within the resource landing page. Searching will also produce a masonry style grid of search results. We can use a third party search plugin for this if you prefer. Individual resource landing pages Each resource that the client uploads to the website will have a dedicated landing page based on a custom post type, similar to this example: https://www.northdoor.co.uk/about-us/resources/rail-delivery-group-case-study-cyber-security-risk/ These pages will include: • A primary H1 title • A subtitle • A featured image • Text describing what the resource is / who it is for and why you should download it • A WPforms based lead capture form for users to complete to be able to download the resource (gated) The form will capture the following details: • Fist name and Last name • Company name • Email address • Mobile phone number • Position within the organisation (dropdown options) • Agreement to privacy settings and terms Gating resources, user accounts and tracking A user must complete a form to register (and be logged in) before they can download any resources. When the user initially completes a resource form, they will be provided with a WordPress user account that will allow them to log in later and access further content freely. Once the form is completed the resource will immediately download to their computer. The user will also receive their login details via email. Along with the form there will be an option to log-in if the user has previously registered, but is not currently logged in. The login screen will be customised and will not look like WordPress. When the user is logged in, they can easily access and download any resources from the library without having to complete any more forms. In this case the form will be replaced by a simple ‘Download the resource’ button – or alternatively the form will remain present but will already have been filled in with their details. Registered and logged in users will not need to complete a form again. Login / register / sign out We will present options to register, sign in and log out at the top right of the user’s screen. There will also be an option for forgotten password. These will not look like WordPress admin. Tracking Whenever a user downloads a resource, this activity will be logged to a CSV file which the client can download at any time from the WPForms dashboard. The CSV will automatically be emailed to the administrators once per week. Partner Pages Where resources are allocated to a supplier, they should appear on the supplier’s page. On these supplier pages, we will display a blade with a title such as ‘Supplier Resources’. The blade will display up to eight resources in a masonry style grid. These will be the latest resources that have been uploaded and allocated to the supplier. There will also be a button to ‘See all [supplier name] resources’. This button will link to the main resource library page, where the results will be pre-filtered to only show all related supplier resources.","posted":"24 days ago","price":"Hourly: $20.00-$30.00","type":"Intermediate","duration":"Less than 1 month, Less than 30 hrs/week","proposal":"Less than 5","country":"United Kingdom","skills":["Website","Web Development","WordPress","Front-End Development","HTML","PHP","JavaScript","CSS","HTML5"],"url":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Website-resources-library_~017fff760d7cd889de/"},{"title":"Tutor LMS +Wordpress","description":"Looking for freelancer who has experience in Tutor LMS & word press Need to update statistical & Mathematical lessons on LMS Other Menu & Widgets issues has to handle","posted":"24 days ago","price":"Hourly: $3.00-$5.00","type":"Intermediate","duration":"Less than 1 month, Less than 30 hrs/week","proposal":"Less than 5","country":"India","skills":["Web Development","WordPress Plugin","WordPress","Learning Management System"],"url":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Tutor-LMS-Wordpress_~0137fedbde5d291901/"},{"title":"Trading View Indicators","description":"I need private and good indicators for my Binance trading bot.

The Scope is typically determined by the drawings of the Architect initially. Some Architects will detail every construction aspect of the home. It is not uncommon however, for an architect to provide minimal drawings. This will depend not only on the architect but also the needs of the owner and the Scope agreed upon by both parties. If the Designer is brought into the project early enough, it is typical the Owner request comments from the designer before final drawings are created. Once the drawings are complete, the Designer will help Owner to verify: Do the drawings define and reflect the owners’ desires and agreed upon wishes OR did the Architect draw the interior design elements purely for bidding purposes, assuming the Owner and Builder will define as the construction process moves along. The next factor in determining the Interior Design Scope of Services is how the Builder/Contractor defines his or her Scope of Services and what information he or she will need throughout the building time frame. The Designer should have proper documentation and approval for all decisions. Often casual conversed and hand sketched ideas are tossed around during the construction process causing confusion and or false Approvals. Once an owner and Builder agree on a design or task, the Owner should approve with a signature, initial, or written email, or whatever is agreed upon. Having approvals in writing should eliminate most errors or misunderstandings. Administration is a big part of the Design Services. Not only is it important to organize the finish and design selections to the builder, it’s also important to organize for the Owner so he and or she can have a visual at all times of the selections that are made. Organization is necessary when making any interior design decisions allowing the Owner to think the design through. SCOPE OF PROJECT, HOWEVER NOT LIMITED TO: 1. THEME 2. EXTERIOR FINISHES: TYPICALLY, ARCHITECT WILL DETERMINE a. Determine Color of windows b. Color or finish of window hardware Exterior colors c.

For windows they also have drivers. But I am making a software that is intended to only filter only see my device (filter by my custom VID & PID etc) and ignore any other conflicting device. Mainly the job of the drivers is to allow a certain range of devices (defined in the device descriptions(VID, PID, string ID etc.)) I can set the custom VID and PID and other stuff in the FT232RQ chips EEPROM using FT-PROG (a reader writer for FTDI chips) available in windows. But if I change them, then my device becomes invisible to any system as the new custom descriptions are not in the default driver. I tired writing to FTDi itself but no response. Hence reaching out here to look for some one who can take the current driver bin packages and add one or two additional device descriptions in them. So that when I install that driver (in mac, windows or linux), the modified FTDI chips (with those device descriptions) can be accessed. I guess FTDi doesn't mind. Note: There are patches that can be done to client systems that already have FTDI drivers, to edit the config files written by those drivers to accomodate the custom devices. But that's not very reliable and patchy and not a good experience.","posted":"1 month ago","price":"Hourly","type":"Expert","duration":"Less than 1 month, Less than 30 hrs/week","proposal":"Less than 5","country":"Thailand","skills":["Website","Pay Per Click Advertising","Paid Media","Affiliate Marketing","Influencer Marketing","Campaign Optimization","Campaign Setup","Dynamic Ad Setup","Display Ad","Mobile Advertising","Desktop Ad","Blog","TikTok","B2C Marketing","Gaming","Startup Company","Advertising","Campaign Management"],"url":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Cross-platform-WIN-MAC-LINUX-FTDI-driver-for-FT232RQ-accomodate-new-device-description_~019ac01628d403f736/"},{"title":"Pop under pop up marketing with different network for advertisement","description":"Looking for someone with expert background on different type of paid advertising through Network like propeller ads, zeropark, traffic stars etc","posted":"1 month ago","price":"Hourly: $10.00-$25.00","type":"Intermediate","duration":"Less than 1 month, Less than 30 hrs/week","proposal":"Less than 5","country":"United States","skills":["Python","Microsoft Excel","Quantitative Analysis","Risk Management","Financial Analysis","Financial Modeling","Algorithm Development","Cryptocurrency","Coding","Quantitative Finance","Quantitative Research","Forex Trading","Investment Research","Coding Art","Project Risk Management"],"url":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Pop-under-pop-marketing-with-different-network-for-advertisement_~01fb8e15da432ee670/"},{"title":"Build a forex compounding algo auto trader","description":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13UP56C06L89cY6l4JSqTtp__9_sbX8pJkDW02p1wMvQ/edit?usp=drivesdk Here is how i would like trading strategy to perform","posted":"1 month ago","price":"Hourly","type":"Intermediate","duration":"Less than 1 month, Less than 30 hrs/week","proposal":"Less than 5","country":"United Kingdom","skills":["Social Media","TikTok","Executive Assistant","Customer Service","Social Media Website"],"url":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Build-forex-compounding-algo-auto-trader_~01a939192970e14dc5/"},{"title":"Hair & make-up","description":"I'm looking for a MUA/hair stylist for natural styling for a video shooting in the morning of Feb 6th.

The setting refers to applications where panel data are available. KK17 does not explore the properties of the random effects model or the degree of identification of the parameters of the model. Through Monte Carlo simulations, the following issues need be discussed: 1. KK17 present a panel data model. There is an abundant literature cataloguing the (mis)behavior of estimators of panel data models under large-N, large-T, and large NT asymptotics. We need to have some guidance regarding the behavior of ML when estimating the KK17 model under different sizes of N and T. This is particularly relevant for the estimation of inefficiency in the dependent variable. 2. This is an instrumental variables (IV) model. The literature on identification via IV is, again, vast. Specifically, we know that weak instruments, on the one hand, and invalid instruments (where the correlation of the instrument and the outcome operates directly, as well as via the endogenous covariates) cause problems for identification. We need an indication of how these problems affect both point estimates and the size and power of the endogeneity test suggested in the paper. 3. In ideal settings (where data are generated from the model itself) ML would be expected to perform well (by which I mean that ML would return consistent and efficient estimates); however, a number of papers have pointed out that specific ranges of parameter values might compromise the identification of models (in the sense that the likelihood function becomes too flat and convergence fails to occur). Does identification break down for moderately large values of the variance and correlation parameters? 4. In ideal settings (where data are generated from the model itself) ML would be expected to perform well (by which I mean that ML would return consistent and efficient estimates); however, what if the model is mis-specified? All of these points above need to be addressed directly via Monte Carlo simulations. All these points are relevant for the estimates of the slopes and the estimates of inefficiency in the model. All of the above can be doable within a very short time, and I can do it myself, but I do not have time. Deliverables include a Stata do program with the Monte Carlo simulations addressing the items above, and a Word document answering the items above and explaining the outcomes of that Stata program by going through the details of the simulations in that program.","posted":"1 month ago","price":"Hourly","type":"Intermediate","duration":"Less than 1 month, Less than 30 hrs/week","proposal":"Less than 5","country":"France","skills":["Google Suite","Virtual Assistance","Task Coordination","Castilian Spanish","Translation","Copywriting","Email Copywriting"],"url":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Monte-Carlo-simulations-with-Stata_~016bcebd17fdbdc3e2/"},{"title":"Lol","description":"Hello!

Their unique selling proposition is clearance sales, variety, relevant customer feedback and customer support. The Challenge FrontierCo is growing rapidly as it expands through cities. They are currently running their services from a colo service provider. Procuring more capacity and setting up the environment is taking time. Customer requires their engineering teams to be more agile and support with integrating more brands and products as they grow. “We need technology that enables us to be very agile in how we operate, so we can efficiently respond to new business opportunities,” says John Smith, COO for FrontierCo. “As part of that, we need to have the capacity to scale compute and storage resources up and down as we need to.” Like all businesses, FrontierCo also strives to manage its operational costs efficiently. As a lean organization, the company constantly looks to innovate in processes and Software to meet that goal. The challenges the customer is facing is customers are facing 504 errors during big day sales, their database is slowing down. They want to have a better way to manage how the customer feedback sections are stored, as it is growing. They also wish to build an online BI tool to track campaigns and the performance of different categories by various parameters. Apart from this to further increase their customer engagement and user experience, they are looking at adding a 5-10 seconds video of the product or a video review of an influencer about this product that helps make better buying decisions.

I have it almost completely built, but there a few technicalities with which I need assistance. The site contains a D3 TopoJSON U.S. county map with data interactivity. The following issues are outstanding: 1. Map zooms in on double-click but it is not easy to zoom out, zoom does not necessarily work on mobile, and pan can move the map out of view entirely. 2. The divs and styling for the map do not appear to render size properly on Safari, Opera, IE... they work well on Chrome and Firefox. 3. I would like to add zoom in/ zoom out/ reset buttons that apply the functionality from 1. 4. I would like to refactor the code for populating the legend, so that moves/resizes automatically on window drag (these work correctly if you click from within a window, but if you click then drag the window size, the divs break down). 5. Related to 4, I would like the legend text to resize automatically to fit and never overflow. 6. If possible, I would like to animate the transitions of the map and legend divs when the legend div appears on county click. 7. There appear to be minor issues in Open Graph metadata tags such that the image does not appear in iMessage, and there are issues with it on Facebook and LinkedIn. I do not anticipate these fixes will involve much time or labor for a skilled D3/web design specialist.

We would like our strategy to be comprehensive and reflective the brand we are trying to create. 2) Create an action plan. This is where we would look to set a budget and determine where we will spend our resources in executing on the strategy. This would include frequency of posts, drip campaign blue print, identifying prospect groups for mailers, etc. These documents are the HOW to execute the strategy. 3) Implementation: This may be bundled or it may fall under a separate project entirely. We would like help getting our marketing efforts off the ground until we are comfortable taking over.

We would like our strategy to be comprehensive and reflective the brand we are trying to create. 2) Create an action plan. This is where we would look to set a budget and determine where we will spend our resources in executing on the strategy. This would include frequency of posts, drip campaign blue print, identifying prospect groups for mailers, etc. These documents are the HOW to execute the strategy. 3) Implementation: This may be bundled or it may fall under a separate project entirely.

We help high net worth clients protect and grow their wealth. We are looking for someone to help us design a comprehensive \"sales growth\" plan. We are looking for a plan tailored to our firm, not generic advice. We envision 3 pieces to this project: 1) Create a marketing strategy: Get to know how business, understand our target market, help us determine appropriate channels to reach them, set KPIs on selected approaches, identify tools we need, etc. Ideally this would include both digital and traditional methodologies (although scope could be narrowed to focus on digital). We would like our strategy to be comprehensive and reflective the brand we are trying to create. 2) Create an action plan. This is where we would look to set a budget and determine where we will spend our resources in executing on the strategy. This would include frequency of posts, drip campaign blue print, identifying prospect groups for mailers, etc. These documents are the HOW to execute the strategy. 3) Implementation: This may be bundled or it may fall under a separate project entirely. We would like help getting our marketing efforts off the ground until we are comfortable taking over. We will likely need help, particularly with the more creative aspects--designing ads, etc. We expect our monthly budget will be relatively small as we get going (~$500 -$1k) but it may ramp up over time depending on level of success with campaigns.
